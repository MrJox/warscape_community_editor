# Rome 2 support (and other games)

The editor is built for Attila; this plan adds Total War: Rome II, generically, so that later games follow the same path. Rome 2's
Assembly Kit has no tiles, no TEd and no BOB tile, vegetation or terrain processors: its tiles come from the packs and go into mod
packs. Formats: docs/formats/rome2_tiles.md; renderer: docs/re/rome2_renderer.md.

Decisions (user, 2026-10-25): mod packs are the only output for Rome 2; a mod overriding a whole tile set file is acceptable; the
Attila ports of BOB's stages are good enough for generated data (checked against the shipped files and in game, no Rome 2 oracle);
siege AI and procedural walls are in scope (they are on branches not merged yet); the game switches live in the editor.

Status legend: **done**, **partial**, **todo**.

## Phase 0: games as data — done

- `wce_foundation::game::GameProfile` (re-exported by `wce_vfs`): key, Steam folder and app id, the preferences folder, rpfm's schema,
  the campaign battle map, the default environment, where the vanilla packs come from (Attila's manifest; a list for Rome 2), and
  `GameFeatures` (`kit_tiles`). `GameProfile::ALL`, `by_key`, `from_env` (`$WCE_GAME_KEY` for the examples and gates).
- The pack order puts the patch packs (header type 2) before the release ones; an empty file in a pack removes the file below it.
- Settings: `game` picks the profile (`Settings::game_profile`); File > Game and the Settings window's Game page switch it live
  (`Editor::switch_game`: the documents close, asking about unsaved ones; `Tool::game_changed`; the packs and the renderer are made
  again; a game not set up opens the first-run dialog, which has the game's combo).
- No `"attila"` literal outside the profiles: mod packs (`wce_vfs::mod_pack`), the tile tool's game data and battle map, the weather
  tool's default environment, the preferences file, Steam detection.
- `Files::game`: the renderer picks its game's passes (`RenderGame`).

## Phase 1: Rome 2's tiles read and written — done (but stage B's terrain and stage C)

- **done** The XML tile database (`rome2::tile_database`), written back byte for byte for all 1,437 tiles.
- **done** `GameData` and `workflow::Game` read the editor's mounted packs (not every pack of the folder) and work without a kit.
- **done** `TileConventions`: the decal sign, the building list layouts (versions 10 to 12, `burn_amount`), the versions the game's
  TEd writes. PROP_MARKER version 4.
- **done** Rome 2's extra files carried (`tile.ted_binary`, `.outlines`); the vegetation carried without vegetation parameters.
- **done** Save to mod pack (all games).
- **done** Stage B for Rome 2: the linking tiles decompiled into the workspace with their final heights; no building stamps (Rome 2's
  buildings have no height-map meshes). Open: the port decimates the meshes more than Rome 2's BOB did (3x fewer vertices).
- **todo** Byte-exact building lists (Rome 2's string table order and size padding: an option of rpfm's ESF encoder).
- **todo** GENERIC_MARKER v1 (one file); multi-list capture location files (two tiles).
- **todo** Stage C for Rome 2: write the older tree / grass lists from the project's trees (the generated ones carried).
- **done** The campaign battle map context for Rome 2: `tile_map` version 6 (16-byte cells; names without the variation: the tile's
  first one), `locations.blm` version 7; the neighbours decompiled from the packs on demand into the cache
  (`workflow::neighbour_root` / `neighbour_tile`, `ContextRequest::provider`). Open: the neighbours draw coarser than the open tile, the
  sea is not drawn (holes).

## Phase 2: Rome 2's renderer — partial

- **done** Shaders of Rome 2's containers (rpfm); tone mapping in log Y; the S-curve's single biases; the weather from folders.
- **done** The terrain (surface, blend, composite, resolve; shadows). Open: the variation textures (the index map is not read).
- **todo** The light pass's new inputs (cloud shade, baked shadows, split depths): check against a frame of the game.
- **todo** The sea (forward ocean), the effects (generated shaders), the rivers and water planes (their shaders exist: to check).
- **todo** Grass and trees (Rome 2's vegetation shaders share the names: to check), decals.

## Phase 3: editor — partial

- **done** Tile menu: Save to mod pack; no Save for / Import from Assembly Kit for a game whose kit has no tiles.
- **todo** Hide what Rome 2 has not: seasons and snow, procedural BMDs, escalation layers, civilian zones, tents (`GameFeatures`).
- **todo** Instance templates and the Create panel's defaults from Rome 2's data (`scripts/re/instance_templates.py` needs a kit).
- **todo** Siege AI and procedural walls once their branches are merged: the wall bases and the siege classes per game.

## Validation without TEd

- Oracles: the game's files (decompile + compile within the text's precision, the database byte for byte), static RE of Rome 2's
  kit DLLs (EmpireUtility, ToolDataBuilderDll) and its `empire.retail.dll`, the game itself (a tile saved into a mod pack and loaded:
  todo, by a human).
- Gates: `scripts/gates.sh` with `WCE_ROME2` (docs/formats/rome2_tiles.md, "Checks").
