# Compiling a TEd project into an exported tile

`wce_tile_io::attila::compile` turns the model of a TEd project (`attila.ted_project`) into the documents of an exported tile
(`attila.tile_binary`), which that format's writer turns into bytes. Plan and status: docs/plans/tile_roundtrip.md, Phase 2 step 4. It
follows TEd's own export (Ghidra, `TEd.AssemblyKit.exe`): stage A, the logic TEd writes, comes first; BOB's stages follow.

Check: `tile_decompile_check` (gates `tile_decompile`, `tile_decompile_all`) decompiles every tile folder of the packs, writes and reads
the project back, compiles it, and compares each document with the binary's, byte for byte and field by field.

## Exactness

The shipped binaries were exported from TEd's floats in memory, finer than tile.ted's `%.6f` text: some of their values come from no
text (an exact 180 degree turn has no euler whose float sine is 0). The check accepts what the text cannot carry (user, 2026-10-22): a
position axis within 4 ulps or 1e-6, a quaternion component within 1e-5; everything else must be identical. Known exceptions, each counted
by name: buildings whose binary quaternion is not unit (TEd's matrix was not a pure rotation; 6 in 3 TDD tiles), starting damages no level
gives with the current building data (an older model's levels; 49), and legacy lists the project carries as files.

## Arithmetic

- A value is read from its text as `sscanf` does (f32). World matrices are `QTU::TedEntity::world_transform`'s
  (`wce_tile::world_transform::ted_world_matrix_f32`: the euler to rotation `FUN_100af1e0`, the parent's times the local, in f32).
- The x87 runs at 53-bit precision: TEd's intermediate results are doubles, rounded to f32 where the code stores a float.

## Building lists (`Ted::BMDExporter::export_`)

- `building_list` from the buildings of the normal layers, `building_list_<layer name in lower case>` from each separate layer
  (`LayerExportType_Separate`; a list even when the layer is empty); off and escalation layers are not in the lists. The buildings in the
  scene's order; record version 12.
- Position (`Ted::transform_to_game_tile_space`): x = world x * 0.5, y = world y, z = extent - world z * 0.5 (extent = the entry's height
  cells * 128).
- Orientation: the world matrix's quaternion, `FUN_00474030` (Shoemake's method on TEd's `MATRIX_44`, whose element (r, c) is at r + 4 c:
  the transpose of the row-major matrix of `ted_world_matrix_f32`).
- Starting damage from `destruction_level` ({level, min 0, max levels - 1}; levels = the most destructs over the building's pieces in its
  `.cs2.parsed`): without the building's `destruct_thresholds` (`battlefield_buildings`) level / max; with them 0, 1 at max, else
  threshold[level - 1].
- `on_fire` = `burn`; `weak_point`, `ai_breachable`, `dockable`, `indestructible`, `toggleable` from the instance (defaults false, true,
  true, false, false); `start_disabled` false, `position_type` 2 (`lf_relative`), scale 1.
- `lite`: the building's position inside a `LiteBuildingZone` of a normal layer (the main list only).

Measured over the packs (1,654 tile folders, 4,063,006 buildings): keys and every flag identical; positions identical or within the
text's precision; quaternions within 1e-5 but the 6 not unit; every `building_list_<layer>` byte-identical.
